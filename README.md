# Quantum Computing Projects by Jas Khetani

Welcome to the Quantum Computing Projects repository, a comprehensive collection of my explorations and implementations in the exciting field of quantum computing. This repository is designed to document my journey from foundational concepts to advanced quantum algorithms, serving as both a personal log and a resource for fellow learners and enthusiasts.

### Quantum Fridays (June 2024)
This repository is a collection of projects in quantum computing as a part of the Quantum Fridays LinkedIn campaign I launched during the month of June of 2024. It contains various beginner-friendly projects to start with and was a part of my apply and learn strategy to understand quantum computing. Some projects were harder than they seemed and hence I left them incomplete and marked them work in progress to continuously research on them and find a solution to post later. The projects:

#### [1. True Coin Flipper 07/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-classicaltoquantum-truerandomness-activity-7204121561799217152-8LJP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
This project introduces the foundational concept of quantum computing: true randomness. By creating a True Coin Flipper using Q# and Qiskit, we demonstrate how quantum computers leverage superposition to achieve genuine randomness, unlike classical computers which rely on pseudo-random algorithms. This beginner-friendly project serves as a gateway to understanding the unique advantages of quantum computing over classical approaches.

#### [2. Bloch Sphere 14/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-blochsphere-qubitsimulation-activity-7207483469151485953-IfyA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
The Bloch Sphere project provides a visual and mathematical exploration of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computing. Unlike classical bits, which are binary, qubits can exist in a superposition of states. This project, implemented in Python using Matplotlib and Numpy, includes a visualizer and a mathematical breakdown of single-qubit gates, allowing users to interact with and understand the complex behaviors of qubits and their operations. It serves as an engaging introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of quantum computing.

#### [3. Quantum Teleportation 21/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-quantumteleportation-ibm-activity-7209990904986640384-ZJKe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
Our Quantum Teleportation project marks the transition to multi-qubit circuits, utilizing entanglement and Bell states. Implemented in IBM Composer, and also written in OpenQASM, Q#, and Qiskit, this project showcases controlled gates like CNOT and CZ, emphasizing their simplicity and significance. This first foray into multi-qubit systems not only illustrates the principle that information cannot travel faster than light but also dispels common myths in quantum computing. Successfully completing this project provides a solid understanding of quantum entanglement and lays the groundwork for further research in this emerging field.

#### [4. Grover's and Shor's Algorithm 28/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-groversalgorithm-shorsalgorithm-activity-7212601504053047297-eGVo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
These are difficult problems requiring more than beginner level understanding of quantum computing and hence the solutions are yet to be posted. Thank you for your patience till now, I will come up with a solution soon.

### Hackathon Projects
This repository contains all of my quantum computing hackathon projects so far. They are usually research-based or recreations of existing technology. This kind of work allows me to understand current technology better by DIYing it by looking at the finest details possible, note, these projects aren't the most efficient however, they can offer insight into solving the same problem differently. The projects:

#### 1. Multi-Qubit Simulator for QuantumBR 2024
This project was on my todo list since a long time and there is a reason for that! It is because the project is unbelievably complex in terms of mathematical calculations for each multi-qubit gate. It took me a while to get to all the gates possible however, submitted only a couple of them for the hackathon so, the project is a long-term one. It is based on the same visualization technique taught in QCTRL Black Opal's Certification course.

### Current Campaign: Qiskit Global Summer School '24
This was a 2-week IBM lead campaign to introduce and develop key skills for researchers in quantum computing and build an intermediate foundation for students on this platform. The campaign goes through 4 labs varying from topics like transpilation, Data Analysis, Error Suppression & Mitigation, and finally Simulating Nature at the Utility Scale.

#### More Projects Coming Soon...

### Repository Purpose and Future Plans
Beyond the current campaign, this repository will continue to grow with new projects and research endeavors. Each addition will be meticulously documented to ensure clarity and reproducibility. Future campaigns and occasional updates will expand on various quantum computing topics, from basic operations to complex algorithms, offering valuable insights and tools for anyone interested in this nascent technology. Please feel free to sponsor my efforts if this repository has proven useful to you in any way!
