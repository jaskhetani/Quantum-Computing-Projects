# Quantum Computing Projects by Jas Khetani

Welcome to the Quantum Computing Projects repository, a comprehensive collection of my explorations and implementations in the exciting field of quantum computing. This repository is designed to document my journey from foundational concepts to advanced quantum algorithms, serving as both a personal log and a resource for fellow learners and enthusiasts.

### Current Campaign: Quantum Fridays (June 2024)
This ongoing campaign aims to introduce and explain key quantum computing concepts through hands-on projects. Each Friday, a new project is added, ranging from single-qubit experiments to multi-qubit circuits. Here are the highlights so far:

#### [1. True Coin Flipper 07/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-classicaltoquantum-truerandomness-activity-7204121561799217152-8LJP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
This project introduces the foundational concept of quantum computing: true randomness. By creating a True Coin Flipper using Q# and Qiskit, we demonstrate how quantum computers leverage superposition to achieve genuine randomness, unlike classical computers which rely on pseudo-random algorithms. This beginner-friendly project serves as a gateway to understanding the unique advantages of quantum computing over classical approaches.

#### [2. Bloch Sphere 14/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-blochsphere-qubitsimulation-activity-7207483469151485953-IfyA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
The Bloch Sphere project provides a visual and mathematical exploration of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computing. Unlike classical bits, which are binary, qubits can exist in a superposition of states. This project, implemented in Python using Matplotlib and Numpy, includes a visualizer and a mathematical breakdown of single-qubit gates, allowing users to interact with and understand the complex behaviors of qubits and their operations. It serves as an engaging introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of quantum computing.

#### [3. Quantum Teleportation 21/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-quantumteleportation-ibm-activity-7209990904986640384-ZJKe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
Our Quantum Teleportation project marks the transition to multi-qubit circuits, utilizing entanglement and Bell states. Implemented in IBM Composer, and also written in OpenQASM, Q#, and Qiskit, this project showcases controlled gates like CNOT and CZ, emphasizing their simplicity and significance. This first foray into multi-qubit systems not only illustrates the principle that information cannot travel faster than light but also dispels common myths in quantum computing. Successfully completing this project provides a solid understanding of quantum entanglement and lays the groundwork for further research in this emerging field.

#### More Projects Coming Soon...

### Repository Purpose and Future Plans
Beyond the current campaign, this repository will continue to grow with new projects and research endeavors. Each addition will be meticulously documented to ensure clarity and reproducibility. Future campaigns and occasional updates will expand on various quantum computing topics, from basic operations to complex algorithms, offering valuable insights and tools for anyone interested in this nascent technology. Please feel free to sponsor my efforts if this repository has proven useful to you in any way!
