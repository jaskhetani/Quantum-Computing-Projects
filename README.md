# Quantum Computing Projects by Jas Khetani

This repository combines multiple campaigns I led during my vacations to deliver beginner-friendly concepts of quantum physics and computing to curious minds. These will be arranged in an increasing order of difficulty depending on your skillset, example: The code is easily comprehensible for Python and C# beginners with a foundational understanding of quantum computing. Please enjoy the quantum buffet of projects listed below:

### Quantum Fridays of June 2024

#### [1. True Coin Flipper 07/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-classicaltoquantum-truerandomness-activity-7204121561799217152-8LJP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
This is the first project that I started with as a quantum programmer! A fine blend of theory and programming in quantum computing explains the key difference between classical and quantum computers and that demonstrates the true power of a quantum computer. There is no doubt about how revolutionizing this field is for students with a computer science background like me, however, this project is relatable even for non-technical people! This is why it is one of my favorite projects of all time and a must-try for every nerd out there!!!

#### [2. Bloch Sphere 14/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-blochsphere-qubitsimulation-activity-7207483469151485953-IfyA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
This project takes us deeper into the world of quantum computing and tackles both the mathematics and conceptual aspects of quantum computing in general. A single-qubit circuit from last time is expanded into a visualization of the same but includes all major gates applicable for a single qubit. This kind of simulation tests a programmer's ability to think outside the box and into a sphere of probabilities! An exciting adventure of Python code, Matplotlib visualization, and Quantum fun !!!

#### [3. Quantum Teleportation 21/Jun/2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jas-khetani_quantumcomputing-quantumteleportation-ibm-activity-7209990904986640384-ZJKe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
